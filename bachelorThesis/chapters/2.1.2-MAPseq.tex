\subsection{MAPseq}\label{subsec:MAPseq}
MAPseq is a quick and accurate tool that assigns taxonomy and Operational taxonomic unit (OTU) classifications to rRNA sequences~\cite{rodrigues_mapseq_2023}. It provides multiple taxonomy classifications and OTU mappings in a single run. MAPseq is 10 times faster than NINJA-OPS and 100 times faster than VSEARCH with 30\%\ higher accuracy in genus classification compared to other tools. MAPseq outperforming the other tools in most of the tests is attributed to improvements in k-mer counting, including an initial pre-clustering step, Needleman-Wunsch alignment for high-scoring segment pairs, and the computation of classification confidence~\cite{matias_rodrigues_mapseq_2017}. The source code and binary packages are freely accessible on GitHub~\cite{rodrigues_mapseq_2023}.
