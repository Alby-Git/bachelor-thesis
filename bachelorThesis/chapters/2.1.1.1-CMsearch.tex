\subsubsection{CMsearch}\label{subsubsec:CMsearch}
CMsearch is a command-line tool from the infernal package. Which receives a sequence database and a covariance model (CM) file as inputs. Covariance models are probabilistic models designed to incorporate both the primary sequence and secondary structure of RNA sequences within a family. CMsearch conducts a search against the database, and generates a list of top scoring hits and hit alignments, ranked by E-values~\cite{nawrocki_infernal_2013}. E-values are computed for every alignment hit, providing an estimate of statistical significance for each match~\cite{kalvari_non-coding_2018}.
