	abstract = {Systemic inflammatory events and localized disease, mediated by the microbiome, may be measured in saliva as head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) diagnostic and prognostic biomonitors. We used a 16S rRNA V3-V5 marker gene approach to compare the saliva microbiome in DNA isolated from Oropharyngeal (OPSCC), Oral Cavity Squamous Cell Carcinoma (OCSCC) patients and normal epithelium controls, to characterize the HNSCC saliva microbiota and examine their abundance before and after surgical resection., The analyses identified a predominance of Firmicutes, Proteobacteria and Bacteroidetes, with less frequent presence of Actinobacteria and Fusobacteria before surgery. At lower taxonomic levels, the most abundant genera were Streptococcus, Prevotella, Haemophilus, Lactobacillus and Veillonella, with lower numbers of Citrobacter and Neisseraceae genus Kingella. HNSCC patients had a significant loss in richness and diversity of microbiota species (p{\textless}0.05) compared to the controls. Overall, the Operational Taxonomic Units network shows that the relative abundance of OTU's within genus Streptococcus, Dialister, and Veillonella can be used to discriminate tumor from control samples (p{\textless}0.05). Tumor samples lost Neisseria, Aggregatibacter (Proteobacteria), Haemophillus (Firmicutes) and Leptotrichia (Fusobacteria). Paired taxa within family Enterobacteriaceae, together with genus Oribacterium, distinguish OCSCC samples from OPSCC and normal samples (p{\textless}0.05). Similarly, only HPV positive samples have an abundance of genus Gemellaceae and Leuconostoc (p{\textless}0.05). Longitudinal analyses of samples taken before and after surgery, revealed a reduction in the alpha diversity measure after surgery, together with an increase of this measure in patients that recurred (p{\textless}0.05). These results suggest that microbiota may be used as HNSCC diagnostic and prognostic biomonitors.},

	abstract = {Technologies to detect the entire bacterial diversity spectra and foodborne pathogens in food represent a fundamental advantage in the control of foodborne illness. Here, we applied high-throughput 16S rRNA sequencing of amplicons obtained by PCR and RT-PCR from extracted DNA and RNA targeting the entire bacterial community and the active bacterial fraction present in some of the most consumed and distributed ready-to-eat (RTE) salad brands in Europe. Customer demands for RTE food are increasing worldwide along with the number of associated foodborne illness and outbreaks. The total aerobic bacterial count in the analyzed samples was in the range of 2–4 × 106 CFU/g (SD ± 1.54 × 106). Culture validated methods did not detect Salmonella spp., Escherichia coli, and other fecal coliforms. 16S rRNA gene Illumina next-generation sequencing (NGS) data were congruent with these culture-based results and confirmed that these and other well-known foodborne bacterial pathogens, such as Listeria, were not detected. However, the fine-resolution of the NGS method unveiled the presence of the opportunistic pathogens Aeromonas hydrophyla and Rahnella aquatilis (relative frequency of 1.33–7.33\%) that were metabolically active in addition to non-pathogenic, active members of Yersinia spp. (relative frequency of 0.0015–0.003\%). The common ail and foxA marker genes of Yersinia enterocolitica were not detected by qPCR. Finally, our NGS data identified to non-pathogenic Pseudomonas spp. as the most abundant and metabolically active bacteria in the analyzed RTE salads (53–75\% of bacterial abundance). Our data demonstrate the power of sequencing, in parallel, both 16S rRNA and rDNA to identify and discriminate those potentially and metabolically active bacteria and pathogens to provide a more complete view that facilitates the control of foodborne diseases, although further work should be conducted to determine the sensitivity of this method for targeting bacteria},

We argue that the ability of every coefficient to measure species-level contributions is a fundamental requirement. By suggesting an additive decomposition formula for the Bray-Curtis coefficient we derive a general formula of dissimilarity, which includes the Canberra distance and the Bray-Curtis dissimilarity as special cases. A similar general formula is also proposed for the Marczewski-Steinhaus coefficient. Finally, using a modified version of Dalton’s principle of transfers, we show that the Bray-Curtis coefficient and the city-block distance exhibit a linear response to the transfer of species abundances from an abundant plot to a less abundant plot. At the other extreme, the chord and the Hellinger distances show an irregular and non-monotonic behavior.},

During an ecological study by one of us, it was noticed that the similarity coefficient of Jaccard6, used in ecology, gives rise to a metric function satisfying the triangle inequality. For two non-empty finite sets X, Y, the Jaccard coefficient is the number of elements in the intersection X∩Y of X and Y. This coefficient (we use absolute value signs to indicate number of elements) has a heuristic interpretation. It measures the probability that an element of at least one of two sets is an element of both, and thus is a reasonable measure of similarity or “overlap” between the two. The one-complement may then be considered a measure of the dissimilarity of the two sets.},

        , Microbiome research has transformed the scientific landscape, as reflected by the exponential increase in microbiome-related publications from many different disciplines. Host-associated microbial communities play a role for almost all aspects of human, animal and plant biology and health. Consequently, there are tremendous expectations for the development of new clinical, agricultural and biotechnological applications of microbiome research. However, the field continues to be largely shaped by descriptive studies, the mechanistic understanding of microbiome functions for their hosts remains fragmentary, and direct applications of microbiome research are lacking. The aim of this review is therefore to provide a general introduction to the technical opportunities and challenges of microbiome research, as well as to make experimental and bioinformatic recommendations, i.e. (i) to avoid, reduce and assess the confounding effects of sample storage, nucleic acid isolation and microbial contamination; (ii) to minimize non-microbial contributions in host-associated microbiome samples; (iii) to sharpen the focus on physiologically relevant microbiome features by distinguishing signals from metabolically active and inactive or dead microbes and by adopting quantitative methods; and (iv) to enforce open data and protocol policies in order increase the transparency, reproducibility and credibility of the field.},

	abstract = {Most experiments studying bacterial microbiomes rely on the PCR amplification of all or part of the gene for the 16S rRNA subunit, which serves as a biomarker for identifying and quantifying the various taxa present in a microbiome sample. Several computational methods exist for analyzing 16S amplicon sequencing. However, the most-used bioinformatics tools cannot produce high quality genus-level or species-level taxonomic calls and may underestimate the potential accuracy of these calls. We used 16S sequencing data from mock bacterial communities to evaluate the sensitivity and specificity of several bioinformatics pipelines and genomic reference libraries used for microbiome analyses, concentrating on measuring the accuracy of species-level taxonomic assignments of 16S amplicon reads. We evaluated the tools DADA2, QIIME 2, Mothur, PathoScope 2, and Kraken 2 in conjunction with reference libraries from Greengenes, SILVA, Kraken 2, and RefSeq. Profiling tools were compared using publicly available mock community data from several sources, comprising 136 samples with varied species richness and evenness, several different amplified regions within the 16S rRNA gene, and both DNA spike-ins and cDNA from collections of plated cells. PathoScope 2 and Kraken 2, both tools designed for whole-genome metagenomics, outperformed DADA2, QIIME 2 using the DADA2 plugin, and Mothur, which are theoretically specialized for 16S analyses. Evaluations of reference libraries identified the SILVA and RefSeq/Kraken 2 Standard libraries as superior in accuracy compared to Greengenes. These findings support PathoScope and Kraken 2 as fully capable, competitive options for genus- and species-level 16S amplicon sequencing data analysis, whole genome sequencing, and metagenomics data tools.},

Over the past 2 years, MGnify (formerly EBI Metagenomics) has more than doubled the number of publicly available analysed datasets held within the resource. Recently, an updated approach to data analysis has been unveiled (version 5.0), replacing the previous single pipeline with multiple analysis pipelines that are tailored according to the input data, and that are formally described using the Common Workflow Language, enabling greater provenance, reusability, and reproducibility. MGnify's new analysis pipelines offer additional approaches for taxonomic assertions based on ribosomal internal transcribed spacer regions (ITS1/2) and expanded protein functional annotations. Biochemical pathways and systems predictions have also been added for assembled contigs. MGnify's growing focus on the assembly of metagenomic data has also seen the number of datasets it has assembled and analysed increase six-fold. The non-redundant protein database constructed from the proteins encoded by these assemblies now exceeds 1 billion sequences. Meanwhile, a newly developed contig viewer provides fine-grained visualisation of the assembled contigs and their enriched annotations.},

The platform provides access to taxonomic assignments and functional annotations for nearly half a million analyses covering metabarcoding, metatranscriptomic, and metagenomic datasets, which are derived from a wide range of different environments. Over the past 3 years, MGnify has not only grown in terms of the number of datasets contained but also increased the breadth of analyses provided, such as the analysis of long-read sequences. The MGnify protein database now exceeds 2.4 billion non-redundant sequences predicted from metagenomic assemblies. This collection is now organised into a relational database making it possible to understand the genomic context of the protein through navigation back to the source assembly and sample metadata, marking a major improvement. To extend beyond the functional annotations already provided in MGnify, we have applied deep learning-based annotation methods. The technology underlying MGnify's Application Programming Interface (API) and website has been upgraded, and we have enabled the ability to perform downstream analysis of the MGnify data through the introduction of a coupled Jupyter Lab environment.},

MGnify's new analysis pipelines offer additional approaches for taxonomic assertions based on ribosomal internal transcribed spacer regions (ITS1/2) and expanded protein functional annotations. Biochemical pathways and systems predictions have also been added for assembled contigs. MGnify's growing focus on the assembly of metagenomic data has also seen the number of datasets it has assembled and analysed increase six-fold.

The results can be used to evaluate microbial diversity at genus, family, order, class, and phylum levels. The resolution is normally insufficient to evaluate the species level. The different steps in the bioinformatical analysis allow both the analysis of all samples combined and comparisons between samples. The bioinformatical analysis focuses on quality control of reads, merging of identical reads, and grouping of reads into operational taxonomic units (OTUs) with a threshold of 97\%. The threshold is inherited from the species threshold for classification of species based on 16S rRNA sequence comparison. The distribution of reads and OTUs within and between samples can be used to estimate α- and β-diversity, respectively. The relative occurrence of the taxonomic units at the levels of genus, family, order, class, and phylum can be compared between samples. These distributions can be related to metadata by principal component analysis.},

	abstract = {Metagenomic sequencing is an increasingly common tool in environmental and biomedical sciences.\&nbsp; While software for detailing the composition of microbial communities using 16S rRNA marker genes is relatively mature, increasingly researchers are interested in identifying changes exhibited within microbial communities under differing environmental conditions. In order to gain maximum value from metagenomic sequence data we must improve the existing analysis environment by providing accessible and scalable computational workflows able to generate reproducible results. Here we describe a complete end-to-end open-source metagenomics workflow running within Galaxy for 16S differential abundance analysis. The workflow accepts 454 or Illumina sequence data (either overlapping or non-overlapping paired end reads) and outputs lists of the operational taxonomic unit (OTUs) exhibiting the greatest change under differing conditions. A range of analysis steps and graphing options are available giving users a high-level of control over their data and analyses. Additionally, users are able to input complex sample-specific metadata information which can be incorporated into differential analysis and used for grouping / colouring within graphs.\&nbsp; Detailed tutorials containing sample data and existing workflows are available for three different input types: overlapping and non-overlapping read pairs as well as for pre-generated Biological Observation Matrix (BIOM) files. Using the Galaxy platform we developed MetaDEGalaxy, a complete metagenomics differential abundance analysis workflow. MetaDEGalaxy is designed for bench scientists working with 16S data who are interested in comparative metagenomics.\&nbsp; MetaDEGalaxy builds on momentum within the wider Galaxy metagenomics community with the hope that more tools will be added as existing methods mature.},

	abstract = {The development of high-throughput sequencing technologies has revolutionised the field of microbial ecology via 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing approaches. Clustering those amplicon sequencing reads into operational taxonomic units (OTUs) using a fixed cut-off is a commonly used approach to estimate microbial diversity. A 97\% threshold was chosen with the intended purpose that resulting OTUs could be interpreted as a proxy for bacterial species. Our results show that the robustness of such a generalised cut-off is questionable when applied to short amplicons only covering one or two variable regions of the 16S rRNA gene. It will lead to biases in diversity metrics and makes it hard to compare results obtained with amplicons derived with different primer sets. The method introduced within this work takes into account the differential evolutional rates of taxonomic lineages in order to define a dynamic and taxonomic-dependent OTU clustering cut-off score. For a taxonomic family consisting of species showing high evolutionary conservation in the amplified variable regions, the cut-off will be more stringent than 97\%. By taking into consideration the amplified variable regions and the taxonomic family when defining this cut-off, such a threshold will lead to more robust results and closer correspondence between OTUs and species. This approach has been implemented in a publicly available software package called DynamiC., More accurate and robust estimates of microbial diversity are generated when performing an OTU clustering step using a dynamic cut-off that integrates bacterial taxonomy and differential evolutionary rates.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Taxonomic profiling of ribosomal RNA (rRNA) sequences has been the accepted norm for inferring the composition of complex microbial ecosystems. Quantitative Insights Into Microbial Ecology (QIIME) and mothur have been the most widely used taxonomic analysis tools for this purpose, with MAPseq and QIIME 2 being two recently released alternatives. However, no independent and direct comparison between these four main tools has been performed. Here, we compared the default classifiers of MAPseq, mothur, QIIME, and QIIME 2 using synthetic simulated datasets comprised of some of the most abundant genera found in the human gut, ocean, and soil environments. We evaluate their accuracy when paired with both different reference databases and variable sub-regions of the 16S rRNA gene.
FINDINGS: We show that QIIME 2 provided the best recall and F-scores at genus and family levels, together with the lowest distance estimates between the observed and simulated samples. However, MAPseq showed the highest precision, with miscall rates consistently {\textless}2\%. Notably, QIIME 2 was the most computationally expensive tool, with CPU time and memory usage almost 2 and 30 times higher than MAPseq, respectively. Using the SILVA database generally yielded a higher recall than using Greengenes, while assignment results of different 16S rRNA variable sub-regions varied up to 40\% between samples analysed with the same pipeline.
CONCLUSIONS: Our results support the use of either QIIME 2 or MAPseq for optimal 16S rRNA gene profiling, and we suggest that the choice between the two should be based on the level of recall, precision, and/or computational performance required.},

While 16S sequencing remains standard procedure for taxonomic profiling of metagenomic data, a growing number of studies have clearly demonstrated biases associated with this method. By using Whole Genome Shotgun sequencing (WGS) metagenomics, most of the known restrictions associated with 16S data are alleviated. However, due to the computationally intensive data analyses and higher sequencing costs, WGS based metagenomics remains a less popular option. Selecting the experiment type that provides a comprehensive, yet manageable amount of information is a challenge encountered in many metagenomics studies. In this work, we created a series of artificial bacterial mixes, each with a different distribution of skin-associated microbial species. These mixes were used to estimate the resolution of two different metagenomic experiments - 16S and WGS - and to evaluate several different bioinformatics approaches for taxonomic read classification. In all test cases, WGS approaches provide much more accurate results, in terms of taxa prediction and abundance estimation, in comparison to those of 16S. Furthermore, we demonstrate that a 16S dataset, analysed using different state of the art techniques and reference databases, can produce widely different results. In light of the fact that most forensic metagenomic analysis are still performed using 16S data, our results are especially important.},

Therefore, the magnitude of beta diversity and its variation across geographic gradients can provide insights into mechanisms of community assembly. Along with limits on local or regional level diversities, effects of local abundance that lead to under-sampling of the regional species pool are important determinants of estimated beta diversity. We explore the effects of regional species pools, abundance distributions, and local abundance to show that patterns in beta diversity as well as the mean of species abundance distribution have distinct outcomes, depending on limits on species pools and under-sampling. We highlight the effect of under-sampling in some established relationships between gamma diversity and beta diversity using graphical methods. We then use empirical data on ant communities across an elevational gradient in the Eastern Himalayas to demonstrate a shift from effect of reduction in species pool to under-sampling at mid-elevations.

	abstract = {Understanding the drivers of diversity is a fundamental question in ecology. Extensive literature discusses different methods for describing diversity and documenting its effects on ecosystem health and function. However, it is widely believed that diversity depends on the intensity of sampling. I discuss a statistical perspective on diversity, framing the diversity of an environment as an unknown parameter, and discussing the bias and variance of plug-in and rarefied estimates. I describe the state of the statistical literature for addressing these problems, focusing on the analysis of microbial diversity. I argue that latent variable models can address issues with variance, but bias corrections need to be utilized as well. I encourage ecologists to use estimates of diversity that account for unobserved species, and to use measurement error models to compare diversity across ecosystems.},

	abstract = {To understand how diversity is distributed in space is a fundamental aim for optimizing future species and community conservation. We examined in parallel species richness and beta diversity components of nine taxonomic groups along a finite space, represented by pastured grasslands along an elevational gradient. Beta diversity, which is assumed to bridge local alpha diversity to regional gamma diversity was partitioned into the two components turnover and nestedness and analyzed at two levels: from the lowest elevation to all other elevations, and between neighboring elevations. Species richness of vascular plants, butterflies, beetles, spiders and earthworms showed a hump-shaped relationship with increasing elevation, while it decreased linearly for grasshoppers and ants, but increased for lichens and bryophytes. For most of the groups, turnover increased with increasing elevational distance along the gradient while nestedness decreased. With regard to step-wise beta diversity, rates of turnover or nestedness did not change notably between neighboring steps for the majority of groups. Our results support the assumption that species communities occupying the same habitat significantly change along elevation, however transition seems to happen continuously and is not detectable between neighboring steps. Our findings, rather than delineating levels of major diversity losses, indicate that conservation actions targeting at a preventive protection for species and their environment in mountainous regions require the consideration of entire spatial settings.},

	abstract = {Neurons transmit information to distant brain regions via long-range axonal projections. In the mouse, area-to-area connections have only been systematically mapped using bulk labeling techniques, which obscure the diverse projections of intermingled single neurons. Here we describe MAPseq (Multiplexed Analysis of Projections by Sequencing), a technique that can map the projections of thousands or even millions of single neurons by labeling large sets of neurons with random RNA sequences ("barcodes"). Axons are filled with barcode mRNA, each putative projection area is dissected, and the barcode mRNA is extracted and sequenced. Applying MAPseq to the locus coeruleus (LC), we find that individual LC neurons have preferred cortical targets. By recasting neuroanatomy, which is traditionally viewed as a problem of microscopy, as a problem of sequencing, MAPseq harnesses advances in sequencing technology to permit high-throughput interrogation of brain circuits.},

	abstract = {Rfam is a database of non-coding RNA families in which each family is represented by a multiple sequence alignment, a consensus secondary structure, and a covariance model. Using a combination of manual and literature-based curation and a custom software pipeline, Rfam converts descriptions of RNA families found in the scientific literature into computational models that can be used to annotate RNAs belonging to those families in any DNA or RNA sequence. Valuable research outputs that are often locked up in figures and supplementary information files are encapsulated in Rfam entries and made accessible through the Rfam Web site. The data produced by Rfam have a broad application, from genome annotation to providing training sets for algorithm development. This article gives an overview of how to search and navigate the Rfam Web site, and how to annotate sequences with RNA families.
